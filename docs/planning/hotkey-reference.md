## Reader — Focus Mode (RSVP Sub-Mode)

| `Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓` | Adjust WPM ±100 |
| `Escape` | Exit to Page view |

On pause: user lands back in Page view at the word they stopped on, highlighted. `Space` re-enters Focus. `Shift+Space` enters Flow instead.

---

## Reader — Flow Mode (Scroll Highlight Sub-Mode)

Entered via `Shift+Space` from Page view. Full text scrolls with word-level highlight walking through.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Pause → return to Page view |
| `←` / `→` | Seek words backward / forward |
| `↑` / `↓` | Adjust WPM ±25 |

| `Escape` | Exit to Page view |

On pause: same as Focus — lands in Page view with word highlighted.

## Reader — Narrate Mode

Entered by selecting Narrate with the bottom-bar button or `N`; playback starts only after Play/Space.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Start/pause narration from the exact selected/current word |
| `N` | Re-select Narrate paused from any mode |
| `C` | Open chapter/book navigation without starting or retargeting narration |
| `↑` / `↓` | Adjust narration speed/rate controls as mapped by the current reader surface |
| `Escape` | Exit to Page view |

Narrate shares the Foliate scrolled surface with Flow, but not Flow's pacer. Flow is driven by `FlowScrollEngine`; Narrate is driven by TTS/audio truth-sync.
