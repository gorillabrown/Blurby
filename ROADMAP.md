## Phase 2 — EPUB Content Fidelity

**Goal:** The existing EPUB converter preserves formatting, images, and structure from all source formats. EPUB becomes the true single canonical internal format with no legacy text fallback.

**Baseline:** `main/epub-converter.js` (769 lines) already converts TXT, MD, HTML, PDF, MOBI/AZW → EPUB. The import pipeline (`main/ipc/library.js`) routes all non-EPUB files through `convertToEpub()`. Foliate renders EPUBs. Legacy text fallback path (`main/legacy-parsers.js`) remains as dead-end for failed conversions.

**Gaps addressed:**
- BUG-033: Book formatting stripped too aggressively (bold, italic, lists, headings lost)
- BUG-034: Images in books stripped during import (not extracted or embedded)
- BUG-075/079: EPUB pipeline completion (DOCX support, URL→EPUB, single rendering path)

---

### Sprint EPUB-2A: Content Fidelity ✅ COMPLETED (v1.5.0, 2026-04-01)

> Full spec archived to `docs/project/ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`. BUG-033/034 resolved. 18 new tests. APPROVED_WITH_CONCERNS (PDF bold/italic and image extraction limited by pdf-parse).

---

### Sprint EPUB-2B: Pipeline Completion ✅ COMPLETED (v1.5.1, 2026-04-01)

> Full spec archived to `docs/project/ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`. BUG-075/079 resolved. 16 new tests. APPROVED — all SUCCESS CRITERIA met. URL→EPUB, Chrome ext→EPUB, legacy migration, single rendering path.

---

## Phase 2 Exit Gate

Phase 2 is complete when:
1. Import any supported format → EPUB generated → opens in foliate with formatting intact
2. URL articles → EPUB (not PDF)
3. Narration extracts words correctly from converted EPUBs
4. All 4 reading modes work on converted content
5. No legacy text rendering path remains
6. `npm test` passes, `npm run build` succeeds
7. Sprint Queue depth ≥3 with Phase 3 spec'd
