# Blurby — Development Roadmap

**Last updated**: 2026-05-17 — Roadmap review: TTS Architecture Complete finish line reached. All 10 conveyor sprints landed. Full phase archived. New finish line TBD.
**Current state**: v1.75.1 stable. Kokoro is the sole active local/cacheable model engine; Web Speech remains a platform fallback. MOSS-Nano and Pocket TTS are dormant/disabled; Qwen retired/disabled. Desktop v2.0 shipped.
**Finish line**: TTS Quality Confidence + Reading Experience v2 — narration UX polish + quality regression gates.
**Queue**: RED (depth 2). 0 full specs + 2 stubs. Next dispatch: requires /roadmap-review.
**Last sprint**: FLOW-ZONE-AUTO (2026-05-19) — descending auto-advancing reading zone replaces fixed-position scroll.
**Queue source of truth**: `docs/governance/sprint-queue.xlsx` is the authoritative FIFO sprint queue. Keep its Catalog and Dashboard tabs current after every dispatch/closeout.

> **Archives:** Completed sprint full specs across `docs/planning/.Archive/ROADMAP_legacy.md` (Phases 1-6), `docs/planning/.Archive/ROADMAP_2026-05-02.md`, `docs/planning/.Archive/ROADMAP_2026-05-14.md`, `docs/planning/.Archive/ROADMAP_2026-05-17.md` (TTS Architecture Completion phase + SK-HYG-2), and `docs/planning/.Archive/ROADMAP_deferred_2026-05-15.md` (completed phase summaries, Track B Chrome Extension, Track C Android APK, Idea Themes). Closeouts in `docs/governance/close-outs/`. Roadmap review artifacts in `docs/planning/roadmap-reviews/`.
>
> **Sprint closeout convention:** Unless a sprint explicitly says otherwise, every successful CLI sprint auto-merges: stage specific files, commit on sprint branch, merge to `main` with `--no-ff`, push, update governance docs and `docs/governance/sprint-queue.xlsx`.

**Dissolved sprints:**
- `TEST-HARNESS-1` — Nano probes irrelevant after Kokoro-only pivot (2026-05-15)
- `TTS-CANARY-1` — Sidecar engines dormant, canary probes unnecessary (2026-05-15)
- `TTS-REGISTRY-DISPATCH-1` — Single active engine, registry dispatch unnecessary (2026-05-15)

## Active & Remaining Sprint Skeletons

### Standing Rules All Skeletons Inherit

1. **PR-2 / PR-3 / POSTV2 type gate:** After any code change run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`; after any UI/dependency change run `npm run build`.
2. **PR-7:** CSS custom properties for all theming — no inline styles.
3. **PR-10:** All JSON writes must be atomic (write-tmp + rename).
4. **PR-12:** Context for cross-cutting concerns (settings, toasts, theme); props for direct parent-child data.
5. **PR-17:** Never drive imperative DOM animations from React useEffect — use a plain class.
6. **PR-26:** Settings that control a runtime engine must have explicit sync bridges.
7. **SRL-012:** For Full-tier sprints, Solon and Plato tasks MUST be marked parallel-eligible.
8. **Queue depth >=3:** If queue drops below 3 after completion, stop and backfill before next dispatch.
9. **Spec-compliance before quality:** Each task gets Solon check (does it match spec?) before Plato check (is it well-built?).
10. **Dispatch sizing:** 40 tool-use ceiling per wave. Sprints with 5+ implementation tasks must be pre-split into waves.

Deviation protocol: a skeleton may override a standing rule only by naming the rule and justifying the waiver in its spec.

> **Architecture context:** AD-1 through AD-4, Cross-Sprint Type-Flow Matrix, Dissolved Sprints, and all grounding evidence / implementation detail in [`ROADMAP_SPECS.md`](ROADMAP_SPECS.md).

### Phase: Reading Experience v2

#### Stage 2 — UX Polish

#### UX-POLISH-1 — Library Cards + Command Palette + Space-Bar Mode *(stub)*

Library card 3-line format (title/author/data), "New" dot auto-clear via IntersectionObserver, Ctrl+K command palette entries for all settings pages, Space bar starts last-used reading mode. Bundle of small high-touch UX wins.

---

#### TTS-QUAL-CI-1 — CI Regression Gate Wiring *(stub)*

Wire `npm run test:quality` into GitHub Actions CI matrix. PRs touching TTS files (`src/hooks/narration/`, `src/utils/audio*`, `src/utils/narrat*`, `src/utils/tts*`) auto-run quality gates. Failure blocks merge. Depends on TTS-EVAL-3 baseline.

---

## Deferred Lanes

- **KOKORO-EXPORT-1** — Long-form audio export (M4B/SRT/ASS). Optional future after Reading Experience v2.
- **Normalizer alignment map** — `normalizedToOriginalMap` transform contract. Revisit when word-position rendering needs original-text cross-reference.
- **Registry-driven strategy dispatch** — Wire `createStrategy?` seam in `ttsProviderRegistry.ts`. Premature while non-Kokoro engines are dormant.
- **Playback-buffered-seconds backpressure** — `scheduler.getBufferedSeconds()` throttle. Revisit if TTS-EVAL-3 soak run reveals buffer pressure.
- **Track B** — Chrome Extension (EXT-ENR-C and beyond)
- **Track C** — Android APK (APK-0 through APK-4)
- **Phase 7** — Cloud Sync
- **Phase 8** — RSS/News
- **Idea Themes A-K** — See `docs/governance/IDEAS.md`

See `docs/planning/.Archive/ROADMAP_deferred_2026-05-15.md` for full deferred specs.

## Notes

- TTS Architecture Complete finish line reached 2026-05-17. All decisions documented in `docs/governance/TTS_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`.
- Desktop v2.0 shipped.
- New finish line established: TTS Quality Confidence + Reading Experience v2 (2026-05-17).
- SSML as internal format explicitly **rejected** per research consensus — structured text + normalizer trace is cleaner than SSML payload. (2026-05-17)
